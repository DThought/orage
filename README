Time-managing application for the Xfce desktop environment.

Xfcalendar 4.3.0.1 uses new ical interface instead of old dbh to store and
utilize calender appointments. 

to use your own version of libical-0.24 you needto copy libical-0.24.pc 
file into your $PKG_CONFIG_PATH directory and possibly fix the first line 
to contain the correct address.

Note that there is no conversion routine to migrate your old data into 
the new format, but you will loose all old appointments and start from
clean table.
