Time-managing application for the Xfce desktop environment.

Xfcalendar 4.3.0.1 uses new ical interface instead of old dbh to store and
utilize calender appointments. 

libical-0.24RC4 version is needed and it comes together with xfcalendar
package.  It contains some minor fixes so you must use this version instead
of base libical-0.24RC4.

Note that there is no conversion routine to migrate your old data into 
the new format, but you will loose all old appointments and start from
clean table.
