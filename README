Time-managing application for the Xfce desktop environment.

Xfcalendar 4.3.0.1 uses new ical interface instead of old dbh to store and
utilize calender appointments. 

You need to copy libical-0.24.pc file into your $PKG_CONFIG_PATH 
directory and possibly fix the first line to contain the correct address.

You need to first go to libical subdirectory and install it:
./configure && make && sudo make install 

Note that there is no conversion routine to migrate your old data into 
the new format, but you will loose all old appointments and start from
clean table.
