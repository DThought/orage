Time-managing application for the Xfce desktop environment.

Orage uses ical interface instead of old dbh to store and
utilize calender appointments.ince version 4.3

libical-0.24RC4 version is needed and it comes together with Orage
package.  It contains several fixes so you must use this version instead
of any base libical version.

Note that there is no conversion routine to migrate your old data into 
the new version (from 4.4 to 4.6 for example) so after each major version
you need to manually add appointments.

First thing you want to do is add your local timezone in the preferences,
If you do not set local timezone, do not use timezones in any appointments
either. It will cause just problems.
