          it was put.
        * More paramaters added: Visibility in Systray, Pager and 
          Taskbar now configurable from standard parameter screen.

---------
	* XfceTrayIcon now both provides "clicked" (a single left button
	  click) and "double_clicked" (double left button click) signals
  	* XfceTrayIcon no longer autoconnects, you'll need to call
	  xfce_tray_icon_connect() explicitly
