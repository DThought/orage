4.4.2
=====
- Recurrence not recurring at the limit date. Missing fix: convert
  time back to UTC when reading. Caused day to be incremented for
  GMT timezones (Bug #2937).
- Added missing last update time (Bug #3431).
- Orage clock now wakes up only when needed. This fix sacrifies a little
  of accuracy to save wakeups. If seconds are not visible clock wakes up
  only once per minute (Bug #3363).
