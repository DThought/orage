    Orage is a time-managing application of the
    <a class="ulink" href="http://www.xfce.org" target="_top">Xfce 4 Desktop Environment
    </a>. It includes a calendar window, list of events and day view.
    Orage has several kinds of alarms and is ical compatible so that you can
    transfer appointments from other calendar systems into Orage or vica versa.
    It also provides an easy way to archive and manage your old appointments.
  </p></div><p> </p><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="orage-getting-started"></a>Getting started</h2></div></div></div><p>
    Orage is started by typing <strong class="application"><code>orage</code></strong> on the command line or in the run
    application window. The command line accepts some optins like -v, which
    tells the version and -h, which shows short usage help. You can also start
    <strong class="application"><code>orage</code></strong> by clicking on the item <strong class="application"><code>orage</code></strong> in the submenu "Office" from the
    desktop menu. Another handy way of starting <strong class="application"><code>orage</code></strong> is to click button 1 on
    orageclock panel plugin. But usually <strong class="application"><code>orage</code></strong> is started automatically as
    part of Xfce startup.
  </p><p>
    The first thing you should do is to adjust your 
    <a class="link" href="#orage-preferences-window" title="The preferences window">preferences</a>. 
    Before adding any appointments, it is strongly recommended to set your
    local <a class="link" href="#preferences-main-tab" title="The main tab">timezone</a>.

    When you run <strong class="application"><code>orage</code></strong>, you will first see the calendar window appearing.
  </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="orage-calendar-window"></a>The calendar window</h2></div></div></div><div class="figure"><a name="default-calendar-fig"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 2. Default Calendar window</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/default_calendar.png" alt="The calendar window."></div></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>
    The calendar window provides you a menu bar giving access to different
    functions. 
    Below that is a standard calendar showing the month, the year, day names 
    and week numbers. At the bottom there is small window showing active 
    TODOs and EVENTs on the selected day. (Empty parts are not shown.)
  </p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="calendar-menu-bar"></a>The menu bar</h3></div></div></div><p>
      The menubar contains four menus: File, Edit, View and Help.

        The file menu contains four items:

          to Orage data. (1) import and export appointments between
          Orage and operating system files or 2) rename Orage files or 3) add 
          and remove foreign calendar files.);
        </li><li>
          Close: hide the calendar window but keep Orage running in the 
          background;

      Calendar view presents you one month, which you can change by pressing
      the arrow beside the month name or the year number or using the mouse 
      wheel.
      Days where you have appointments or where you have ending TODO are
      marked as bold. One day is always selected and shown with a block.
      You can change the selected day by single clicking any day number.
      Double clicking a day number causes event list window for that day to be
      activated.
    </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="calendar-todo-window"></a>The TODO list</h3></div></div></div><p>
      The bottom window lists your active TODOs. You can scroll to see
      them all. Red means the TODO is late (due date has passed). Blue means 
      that the TODO is active (start time has passed, but you still have time
      before the due time passes). And black means a future TODO.
      You can edit TODOs by double clicking the row. All rows have tooltips,
      which show more details about the TODO.
    </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="calendar-events-window"></a>The EVENT list</h3></div></div></div><p>
      Below the TODO list you see your events from the selected date.
      Check the tooltip for more details of the event. Also events can be 
      edited by double clikcing them.
    </p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="orage-eventlist-window"></a>The event list window</h2></div></div></div><div class="figure"><a name="orage-eventlist-fig"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 7. Orage event list window</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/orage_eventlist.png" alt="The event list window."></div></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>
    The event list (or appointment list as it is also called) window shows all
    activites that you have reserved for the day (date is shown in the window
    heading in your locale format).
    On top of the window you have menu and buttons to do actions.
    This is your main activity window and you may want to keep it up all the
    day and even make it to appear on all workspaces or to be always on top
    of other windows.
  </p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="event%20list-action-bar"></a>The button bar</h3></div></div></div><p>
      There are ten activity buttons in the button bar from left to right:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
        New: start an <a class="link" href="#orage-appointment-window" title="The appointment window">
        appointment window</a> for creating a new appointment for this day;
      </li><li>
        Duplicate: also start an <a class="ulink" href="#orage-appointment-window" target="_top">
        appointment window</a> for creating a new appointment for
        this day. But do not start from scratch, but copy all values
        from the active row in the appointment list below. Note that
        if you do not have any rows selected from the event list, this
        button does not do anything (but gives a warning);
      </li><li>
        Delete: remove all selected appointments. There is no undo, so be 
        carefull with this button! Before removing anything Orage asks for 
        your verification.
      </li><li>
        Back: show previous day; 
      </li><li>
        Today: show today; 
      </li><li>
        Forward: show next day; 
      </li><li>
        Refresh: redisplay this date;
      </li><li>
        Find: activate the search tab;
      </li><li>
        Close: close this window; 
      </li><li>
        Dayview: start day list window;
      </li></ul></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="eventlist-tabs"></a>The tabs</h3></div></div></div><p>
      Each of the four tabs selects the type of appointments to show. 
      There may also be extra selections possible depending on the tab. 
      You can select tab by clikcing it or by using the mouse wheel. 
      Let's check each tab:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
        Event: the event tab shows all EVENT type appointments happening on 
        this day. It is possible to see more than one day in this tab 
        by setting "Extra days to show" number to larger than 0. Each number
        shows one more day. (It causes the Time column in the event listing 
        to show also the date.)
      </li><li>
        Todo: shows your active TODOs similarly than in the main calendar
        window. Only active ones are shown. If you want to see old TODOs,
        you need to find them in Search tab.
      </li><li>
        Journal: lists your notebook entries starting from certain date.
        Default start date is one year back and you can not change the 
        default setting.
      </li><li>
        Search: enter a free text, which is searched from all the appointments.
        Usually the search is case independent, but for some utf8 characters 
        Orage switches to case sensitive search method. This happens if the 
        length of the string is different in upper case compared to lower case
        (for example German language double s causes this).
      </li></ul></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="eventlist-appointments"></a>The appointment list</h3></div></div></div><p>
      The list shows all appointments satisfying the conditions and tab type.
      Scrollbars will appear if there are more lines or longer lines than 
      what fits into the window. You can edit any appointment by double 
      clicking the row. Note that each repeating appointment is shown only 
      once (=first time) instead of everytime it happens in the specified days.
      Each line has three fields:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
        Time: the starting and ending times of the appointment (the format
        varies depending on tab and appointment). All times are always shown
        in our local timezone. It is possible to define special whole day
        appointments and they have a text "All day" instead of real start and
        end times. Rows appear in start time order.
        +sign in front of the time means that the appointment started on some
        previous day and correspondingly +sign at the end of the time means
        that appointment continues and ends later than the selected day.
        If the Event tab shows today, there are few extra formattings used:
        When the event has passed, it is overstriked. Currently active 
        events are shown with blue colour and future events are bold. 
      </li><li>
        Flags: gives information about the appointment. If your appointment
        has a category which has been associated with a clour, flags field has
        that colour background. (Note that the explanations are visible as
        a hint when you move your cursor into the appointment list.)
        There are five flags in order:
        <div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li>
            Alarm: what kind of action happens when alarm time passes.
            <span class="keycap"><strong>n</strong></span> means no alarm has been defined.
            <span class="keycap"><strong>A</strong></span> means that visible window is raised.
            <span class="keycap"><strong>S</strong></span> means that sound is played.
            (If both visual and sound alarm is defined, S is shown)
          </li><li>
            Repeat: how often is that appointment happening.
            <span class="keycap"><strong>n</strong></span> means no repeating so that this event only
            happens once. 
            <span class="keycap"><strong>D</strong></span> means daily repeat,
            <span class="keycap"><strong>W</strong></span> weekly, 
            <span class="keycap"><strong>M</strong></span> monthly and
            <span class="keycap"><strong>Y</strong></span> yearly.
          </li><li>
            Type: what kind of reservation is this. Two options:
            <span class="keycap"><strong>f</strong></span> means free so that the action is not reserving
            the time and it is possible to schedule more appointments at the
            same time and respectively 
            <span class="keycap"><strong>B</strong></span> means busy, so that
            nothing else can be done at this time.  Note that current
            version of <strong class="application"><code>orage</code></strong> does not enforce these and the flag is only as a
            comment (in the future this may be enforced).
          </li><li>
            File: where this appointment is stored.
            <span class="keycap"><strong>O</strong></span> means it is in the standard active Orage file,
            <span class="keycap"><strong>A</strong></span> in the archive file. (The appointment is
            automatically unarchived if it is edited.). Archived appointments
            can only be found in the Search and Journal tabs.
            <span class="keycap"><strong>F</strong></span> appointment is in foreign file; in other words
            it is not native Orage appointment.
          </li><li>
            Appointment type: 
            <span class="keycap"><strong>E</strong></span> for EVENT,
            <span class="keycap"><strong>T</strong></span> for TODO and
            <span class="keycap"><strong>J</strong></span> for JOURNAL.
            This flag is usefull only in search tab since the tab name
            informs the type in other tabs.
          </li></ul></div></li><li>
        Title: the heading of the appointment. Note that the whole title is
        shown, so you may want to avoid using too long titles to keep the view
        cleaner.
      </li></ul></div></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="orage-daylist-window"></a>The day list window</h2></div></div></div><div class="figure"><a name="orage-daylist-fig"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 8. Orage day list window</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/orage_daylist.png" alt="The day list window."></div></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>
    The day list window shows all events that you have reserved for the
    next days. Default is to show 7 days, but you can change that and see
    up to 40 days at once.
    On top of the window you have menu and buttons to do actions.
    This is another form of your main activity window and more usefull than
    event list window if you want to find room for your new events or see your
    agenda and free time from longer perod than one day.
  </p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="daylist-action-bar"></a>The button bar</h3></div></div></div><p>

      Biggest part of the window is the day list area. You can click the 
      header of the day to open 
      <a class="link" href="#orage-eventlist-window" title="The event list window">event list window</a>
      for that day. First line contains full day events when defined. The other
      lines contain events that you have scheduled. Each event has tooltip
      which include appointment details. You can update the event by double
      clicking it. Events are placed on the start time row and even if the 
      length is several hours, the event is only visible on single row. If
      the event is taking time (availability=Busy), there is vertical line
      in front of it showing its length. These lines show how full your
      calendar is and makes it easier to find free time quickly. If more than
      one events starts at the same hour, they all are added to the same row /
      column after each other and the reservation line is the sum of them.

    The appointment window is used to add, edit and delete appointments.
    It is the most complex window in <strong class="application"><code>orage</code></strong>, but most fields still have good
    default values and are not mandatory. It has button bar (All actions are
    also available in menus above the buttons) and three tabs controlling
    basic settings and alarms and recurrence settings.
  </p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="appointment-action-bar"></a>The button bar</h3></div></div></div><p>
      There are 5 activity buttons in the button bar from left to right:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
        Save: store the appointment to the orage system. This causes
        also data validity checking.
      </li><li>
        Save and close: like Save, but also closes the window.
      </li><li>
        Revert: undo all changes done after previous save. Note that
        this button is active only after data has been changed.
      </li><li>
        Duplicate: start creating new appointment and copy all values
        from the current activity into it. The new appointment is not created
        until you press <span class="guibutton"><strong>Save</strong></span>.
      </li><li>
        Delete: remove current appointment permanently from orage
        system.
      </li></ul></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="appointment-general-tab"></a>The general tab</h3></div></div></div><div class="figure"><a name="orage-appointment-fig"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 9. Orage appointment window - general tab</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/orage_appointment.png" alt="The appointment window."></div></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>

    </p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Type</span></dt><dd><p>
            Orage can handle three types of appointments: 
          </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
              Event is something that happens sometimes. It has start and 
              end time. This is the most common appointment type and you 
              actually can handle all cases with this, since it also is the 
              most flexible type. So if you are not sure what type to choose, 
              Event is your best bet. Events either reserve your time 
              (Availability=Busy) or are free which means this event does not
              take time from your schedule. 
            </li><li>
              Todo is some action that you need to complete. It
              usually has a start time and due time when it has to be finished.
              It has no end time, which is replaced by the due time. You can
              also use duration similarly than with events. Todos have no 
              availability, but instead they have completed time. After you
              set the completed time, the todo is done and is removed from 
              lists visible in main calendar and in todo appontment tab. 
            </li><li>
              Journals are just notes. They do not have end times nor
              availability. It is not possible to add alarm or recurrency for
              journals.
            </li></ul></div></dd><dt><span class="term">Title</span></dt><dd><p>
            The title of the appointment. It appears in the event list
            and also in the alarm window and is listed at the header of this
            window. It should be a rather short summary of the appointment.
          </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Location (Event and Todo)</span></dt><dd><p>
            This field should describe where the event happens. It can
            be for example Home or Office or Paris depending on what kind of
            appointment you have. It is also possible to leave it empty. <strong class="application"><code>orage</code></strong>
            is not using it in any special way, nor is it visible anywhere 
            else than here. Journals do not have location.
          </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><a name="all-day-event"></a>All day event</span></dt><dd><p>
            Selecting this checkbox causes so called whole day appointment
            to be defined. These do not have start nor end time defined, but
            it is possible that the event lasts several days. Start time is
            assumed to be the beginning of the day at 00:00 and end date
            at the last day at 24:00.
          </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Start</span></dt><dd><p>
            Defines the start time of the appointment. First, press the    
            date button and choose the date from the calendar. After that
            you set the hour and minute using either your mouse wheel or
            clicking the small arrows. It is also possible to type the
            numbers directly to the fields. Hours go from 0 to 23 (24 is not
            allowed value).
          </p><p>
            The last button is timezone. Default value for new
            appointments is your current timezone, which you have set in the
            preferences. It is recommended to use real timezones instead of
            floating. You should not mix floating with real timezones although 
            it is possible. Floating means that time is not bound to any
            timezone, but varies according to current settings. Modifying
            either the default timezone or start timezone may cause floating
            values to change.
          </p></dd><dt><span class="term">End (Event)</span></dt><dd><p>
            Similar to Start, but defines naturally the ending time. Note
            that start and end timezones may be different (for example when
            you schedule a meeting in abroad you can set the starting time in
            your local timezone and the rest of the timings in the destination
            timezone).
            <a class="link" href="#orage-eventlist-window" title="The event list window"> Event list window</a>
            always shows times in your local time. Only events have end time.
          </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Due (Todo)</span></dt><dd><p>
            Similar to End, but defines the time where the todo should be 
            completed. Only todos have due time.
          </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Duration (Event and Todo)</span></dt><dd><p>
            Often it is easier to set the appointment duration instead of
            ending (or due) time. You can do that by marking the first box 
            here. It is not possible to have both end/due time and duration 
            at the same time, so end/due time setting will be unavailable
            after you select duration.
            Maximum duration is 1000 days, which is almost three years. Note
            that although the minute selection jumps 5 minutes at a time, you
            can manually enter any number.
          </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Availability (Event)</span></dt><dd><p>
            What kind of reservation is this. There are two possiblities:
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Free</em></span> means that the action is not reserving
            the time and it is possible to schedule more appointments at the
            same time and respectively <span class="emphasis"><em>Busy</em></span> means that
            nothing else can not be done at this time.  Note that current
            version of <strong class="application"><code>orage</code></strong> does not enforce these menings and the flag is
            only as a comment (in the future this may be checked).
          </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Completed (Todo)</span></dt><dd><p>
            By selecting the Done box you mark this todo as done. The completed
            time can then be set. Format is similar to other times (like 
            Start). Only todos have completed time.
          </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Categories</span></dt><dd><p>
            Free format text, which you can use to categorize your appointment.
            It is also possible to create a list of categories and associate
            those to colours. You can then pick one of those and get your
            appointment to be show with that colour in the event list window.
          </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Note</span></dt><dd><p>
            Free format text, where you can and should explain more
            the appointment. It is shown in the alarm window. Scrollbars
            appear when needed.
          </p></dd></dl></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="appointment-alarm-tab"></a>The alarm tab</h3></div></div></div><div class="figure"><a name="orage-appointment-alarm-fig"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 10. Orage appointment window - alarm tab</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/orage_appointment_alarm.png" alt="The appointment alarm tab."></div></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>
      In this tab, you define the alarm for the appointment. <strong class="application"><code>orage</code></strong> supports 
      three kinds of alarms: window, sound and procedure, but they all happen
      at the same time. It is possible to define only one alarm time for each
      appointment. To cause an alarm you need to do two things: You have to
      define alarm time and select alarm type. By default alarm happens 5
      minutes before the appointment start time. Default alarm is Orage
      window without sound.
    </p><p>
      Alarm time is set if any of the alarm timing numbers is non zero (in
      other words there is no special flag to set alarm; just define the time
      for it. This also prevents setting alarm to happen exactly at the
      appointment start/end time).  You need explicitely select each alarm type
      by crossing the Use box. If you do not choose any alarm types, the alarm
      does not happen.
    </p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Alarm time</span></dt><dd><p>
            Define how much earlier or later the alarm happens. If all numbers
            are zero, no alarm is raised for this appointment. The last field
            defines what these alarm offset numbers mean. You can define alarm
            to happen based on start or end time of the appointment and also
            if it happens after or before the time. Default is to alarm
            before the start time of the appointment. But specially for todos
            it is often more usefull to raise alarm before the due (=end) time.
          </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Persistent alarm</span></dt><dd><p>
            When <strong class="application"><code>orage</code></strong> is not running (for example if your computer is shutdown)
            alarms can't happen. If you want to get reminders after <strong class="application"><code>orage</code></strong>
            starts again, you need to set the alarm as persistent. By default
            alarms are just lost.
          </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Sound</span></dt><dd><p>
            Define the sound file to be played when the alarm fires.
            Leaving this empty disables sound alarm. Remember to define the
            actual play command in the
            <a class="link" href="#orage-preferences-window" title="The preferences window">preferences dialog</a>.
            You should also test that your system can play the filetype you
            choose there. Simply start a terminal and test it using the
            command you specified and the sound file.
          </p><p>
            By default alarm sound is played only once, but you can make it
            repeated by choosing the box next line. You can also define how
            many time it is repeated and what is the interval. Be carefull
            to set the interval longer than the length of the sound since
            <strong class="application"><code>orage</code></strong> does not wait for the previous sound to end before starting
            the next sound after the interval.
            Note that there is a silence button in visual alarms, so that you
            can stop the noise, but that only prevents the next play to happen,
            it does not interrupt currently playing alarm, which you should
            remember when using long lasting soundfiles.
          </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Visual</span></dt><dd><p>
            <strong class="application"><code>orage</code></strong> can show two kinds of internal visual alarms. Orage window
            is a small alarm window showing the heading and note text. 
            Notification is more fancy notification using libnotify. You need
            to have libnotify installed before you can define this kind of
            visual alarm. <span class="command"><strong>orage -v</strong></span> shows if you have
            libnotify support included.
          </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Procedure</span></dt><dd><p>
            This makes it possible to use external alarms. You can run any
            operating system command or script. Common use for this is sending
            email.
          </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Default alarm</span></dt><dd><p>
            You can either set alarm back to default options or you can store
            current settings to be default alarm for all new appointments.
            There is only one default alarm, which applies to all appointments.
          </p></dd></dl></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="appointment-recurrence-tab"></a>The recurrence tab</h3></div></div></div><div class="figure"><a name="orage-appointment-recurrence-fig"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 11. Orage appointment window - recurrence tab</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/orage_appointment_recurrence.png" alt="The appointment recurrence tab."></div></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>
      In this tab you can define repeating appointments. Often it makes
      sense that the same appointment happens every day or every month instead
      of creating a new appointment for each event. Note that <strong class="application"><code>orage</code></strong> does not 
      support exclusions (like you would like to skip holiday period from you
      work related appointments), so you have to end the whole recurrency
      and enable it again after it need to resume. <strong class="application"><code>orage</code></strong> also misses the 
      possibility to modify only one specific event from a recurring set. All
      changes affect the whole set of appointments.
    </p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Complexity</span></dt><dd><p>
            Default is Basic and that makes it possible to define frequency 
            and limit of the appointment only. Often that is enough and these 
            settings are very easy and fast to do even if you are not familiar 
            with calendars and alarms. Selecting Advanced gives you more 
            possibilities and makes it possible to build complex recurrent 
            appointments like for example:
            </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
                Every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.
              </li><li>
                Last Tuesday on every second month.
              </li></ul></div><p>
          </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Frequency</span></dt><dd><p>
            This is the base repeating period. Default is no repeat (=None)
            and other possibilities are daily, weekly, monthly and yearly.
          </p><p>
            The next selection makes it possible to easily skip some periods.
            Default value is 1 and it means every time as specified in the 
            Frequency selection. 2 means every second time and 3 every third
            time etc. For example if you want to schedule your meeting to
            happen every third week, select Frequency = Weekly and set Interval
            to 3. (Starting time is selected in the 
            <a class="link" href="#appointment-general-tab" title="The general tab"> General tab</a> 
            and next event happens exactly 3 weeks from that)
          </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Limit</span></dt><dd><p>
            <strong class="application"><code>orage</code></strong> allows you also to limit the repeating count:
            </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
                Repeat forever: this is default and does not limit the
                number of occurrences at all.
              </li><li>
                Repeat n times: the appointment is scheduled exactly n
                times. After that it ends (but is not removed).
              </li><li>
                Repeat until date: you can select the last date when this
                event happens. Note that it still happens normally during this 
                date.
              </li></ul></div><p>
          </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Weekdays (Advanced)</span></dt><dd><p>
            Default is that all days are checked, which means that the event
            happens normally every day. By removing any check, you prevent 
            the appointment to happen on that day. In other words, your 
            appointment only happens on checked weekdays. The most natural
            usage of this is to use it with Frequency = Daily. You may want
            to have a chat meeting for example each Monday and Wednesday. You
            can do this by selecting Frequency = Daily and by checking only
            Weekdays Mon and Wed. 
          </p><p>
            Selecting Weekly or Monthly actually causes the same thing. 
            Deselecting any weekday for weekly or monthly or yearly repeating
            appointments causes all the remaining weekdays to become selected 
            even though the original repeating selection only selects one day 
            from the period. This is needed so that it is possible to schedule 
            for example a meeting to happen every second week on Tuesday and 
            Friday (Frequency = weekly, Interval = 2, Weekdays = Tue and Fri).
          </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Which day (Advanced)</span></dt><dd><p>
            This setting can only be used for monthly and yearly repeating
            events. It can be used to select which weekday from the month or
            year is selected. For example if you want to schedule your
            meeting to happen on the first Tuesday of every month, you can first
            select Frequency = Monthly and then check only Tuesday from Weekdays
            and finally set this "which day" number to be 1 (choose the number 
            located below Tuesday). Negative numbers count backwards starting 
            from the end of period and zero means that this setting is not used.
            Frequency = Yearly, weekdays = Thursday only clicked and which say =
            -2 means second last Thursday of the year.

            It is possible to relocate and rename both active <strong class="application"><code>orage</code></strong> file

                files at all. The new file has to exist before this operation
                can be done. First copy the file in you operating system

            <strong class="application"><code>orage</code></strong> can include and maintain other than its main data file.
            It is possible to add (and remove) so called foreign files. They
            behave similarly than base data file, but they remain isolated, 
            so that it is easy to move them back to the original system
            where they came from. This is mainly meant to be used when you
            need to maintain your calendar also in other than <strong class="application"><code>orage</code></strong>. Sometimes
            it is good idea to mark the file as read only, which prevents
            you from modifying any of the appoinments in the corresposnding
            file. (Orage uses some private ical components, which are not
            necessarily understood by the other system, so updates may cause
            problems for the other tool.)
          </p><p>
            You can also add foreign files from the operating system using
            command line.

    The preferences window is used to enter initial values for <strong class="application"><code>orage</code></strong>.
    You can define for example several display options, how old appointments
    should be archived and what is the play command to be used for playing
    sound alarms and also you can set the local timezone for <strong class="application"><code>orage</code></strong>.
  </p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="preferences-main-tab"></a>The main tab</h3></div></div></div><div class="figure"><a name="orage-preferences-main-fig"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 15. Orage preferences window - main tab</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/orage_preferences_main.png" alt="The preferences main tab."></div></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Timezone</span></dt><dd><p>
            You should always set the default timezone for <strong class="application"><code>orage</code></strong>. It is
            possible to use also floating times, but then all times should be
            in floating form. It is a bad idea to mix floating and timezone
            times. Floating times tend to move to follow any timezones they
            see...
        </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Archive threshold</span></dt><dd><p>
            <strong class="application"><code>orage</code></strong> does not delete appointments automatically, so usually your
            calendar file grows bigger and because of that <strong class="application"><code>orage</code></strong> gets slower
            and takes up more memory from the system. Enabling automatic      
            archiving causes old appointments to be moved from the active
            calendar file to passive history file after the selected time.
            This helps to keep the active file smaller and the application in
            good shape. Archiving is enabled by setting the threshold to other
            than 0 value. Of course it is also possible to manually delete
            appointments, but that removes them permanently and you will not
            be able to find them later.
          </p><p>
            Note that <strong class="application"><code>orage</code></strong> also splits
        <a class="link" href="#appointment-recurrence-tab" title="The recurrence tab">recurring appointments</a>
            so that if the original start date is older than threshold, that
            appointment is added to the archive file and the starting date in
            the active calendar file is updated to contain only values more
            recent than the threshold. This also saves time when <strong class="application"><code>orage</code></strong> is
            searching recurrent events.
          </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Sound command</span></dt><dd><p>
            Here you can define which sound command <strong class="application"><code>orage</code></strong> uses when playing
            sound files. Try testing some common commands like play or aplay 
            from terminal to see what works in your system. You probably do
            not want to use full version of totem or mplayer since they will
            cause a video window also to appear and that most probably is not
            what you want.
          </p><p>
            Basically it is possible to do other than sound commands also since 
            <strong class="application"><code>orage</code></strong> really only starts this program and gives it
            <a class="link" href="#appointment-alarm-tab" title="The alarm tab">the sound file</a>
            as parameter. But this is not the intention of this feature.

            Finally <strong class="application"><code>orage</code></strong> switches to static icon if not even the number fits

          This really is a problem in your distro. You can check how your
          operating system reports these to GTK+ and hence to <strong class="application"><code>orage</code></strong>, which
          uses strictly gtk calendar widget and does not tune these settings
          itself. Command <span class="command"><strong>locale first_weekday</strong></span> shows
          which day is the first day in your system. Usually Sunday is day
          number 1, but that can be changed so check that with command
          <span class="command"><strong>locale day</strong></span>, which shows days starting from day 
          number 1. You may try with different LANG enevironment variable
          settings and calendar view in <strong class="application"><code>orage</code></strong> should change accordingly. Log
          a new bug for <strong class="application"><code>orage</code></strong> if you think it is not working correctly.

          If you are adventurous, you can actually fix these yourself. You
          need to find your locale definition file (like fi_FI or fr_FR). 
          <span class="command"><strong>locate</strong></span> is your friend here and helps finding it.
          After that you can check what the setting is: 
          <span class="command"><strong>grep first_weekday fi_FI</strong></span> and change that if it is
          wrong and after that you need to recompile your locale database.

          This is common requirement. You may for example have work related
          meetings happening every week and when you are on holiday you would
          not like to get alarmed by those nor would you like to see those.
          The iCal standard uses term "Exception Dates" for this kind of
          feature, but unfortunately <strong class="application"><code>orage</code></strong> does not include that feature.
          The easiest way probably is to end those appointment with end date
